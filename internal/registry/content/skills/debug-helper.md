## What I do

- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Identify potential root causes
- Suggest debugging steps
- Recommend fixes

## My approach

1. **Understand**: What error/behavior are you seeing?
2. **Reproduce**: Can we reliably trigger the issue?
3. **Isolate**: Narrow down where the problem is
4. **Hypothesize**: What could cause this?
5. **Test**: Verify hypotheses
6. **Fix**: Implement and verify the solution

## Information I need

- Error message / stack trace
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Recent changes that might be related
- Environment details (OS, versions, etc.)

## Common issues I help with

- Runtime errors and exceptions
- Logic bugs
- Performance issues
- Integration problems
- Configuration issues
