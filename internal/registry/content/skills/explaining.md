# Explaining Code

Breaks down complex code into understandable parts.

## Approach

1. **Overview**: What does this code do at a high level?
2. **Components**: Break down into logical parts
3. **Flow**: How does data/control flow through?
4. **Details**: Explain tricky or non-obvious parts
5. **Patterns**: Identify design patterns used
6. **Improvements**: Suggest potential enhancements
