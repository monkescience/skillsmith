## What I do

- Review pull request changes thoroughly
- Provide structured feedback using conventional comments
- Identify potential issues and improvements
- Suggest specific code changes where helpful

## Feedback format

I use conventional comment labels:

- `praise:` - Highlight something done well
- `nitpick:` - Minor style/preference, non-blocking
- `suggestion:` - Propose an alternative approach
- `issue:` - Something that must be addressed
- `question:` - Seeking clarification

## When to use me

Use this skill when reviewing a PR before merging.
Provide me with the PR URL or diff to review.
